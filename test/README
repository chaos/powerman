On running 'make check':

The test methodology here is to run the powerman daemon as a child
of the powerman client, connected via pty.   The powerman daemon in
turn spawns copies of 'vpcd' (virtual power control device), connected
via ptys.  Each test starts a fresh powerman+powermand+vpcd(s) so no
state is preserved between tests.  Root privilege or available well known
ports are not required to run these tests.

The client can send multiple commands, so we can send commands and
change state and then query the state to see what happened.

The output of each command is compared against expected output.

The tests are summarized here:

t35
	Powerman as a pseudo-power controller, direct mapping.
t36
	Powerman as a pseudo-power controller, remapped.
t42-t43
	Test DLI LPC using dli.c	
t44
	Test Sun ILOM using ilom.c
t45
	Test Rackable Phantom using phantom.c
t47
	Test FreeIPMI ipmipower using ipmipower.c
t50
	Test bashfun demo script.
t51
	Test Sun LOM using lom.c
t61
        Test httppower openbmc using openbmc-httppower.c

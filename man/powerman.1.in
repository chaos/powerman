.TH powerman 1 "1 December 2008" "@PACKAGE_NAME@-@PACKAGE_VERSION@"
.SH NAME
powerman \- power on/off nodes
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pm
.I "[-options] -action [targets] [-action [targets] ...]"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B powerman
provides power management in a data center or compute cluster environment.
It performs operations such as power on, power off, and power cycle
via remote power controller (RPC) devices.
Target hostnames are mapped to plugs on RPC devices in
.I powerman.conf(5).
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.I "-1, --on targets"
Power ON targets.
.TP
.I "-0, --off targets"
Power OFF targets.
.TP
.I "-c, --cycle targets"
Power cycle targets.
.TP
.I "-q, --query-all"
Query plug status of all targets.
Status is not cached;  each time this option is used, powermand
queries the appropriate RPC's.  Targets connected to RPC's that could
not be contacted (e.g. due to network failure) are reported as
status "unknown".  If possible, output will be compressed into host
ranges.
.TP
.I "-Q, --query targets"
Query plug status of specific targets.
.TP
.I "-h, --server-host host[:port]"
Connect to a powerman daemon on non-default host and optionally port.
.TP
.I "-x, --exprange"
Expand host ranges in query responses.
.TP
.I "-l, --list"
List available targets.  If possible, output will be compressed into
a host range (see TARGET SPECIFICATION below).
.TP
.I "-V, --version"
Display the powerman version number and exit.
.TP
.I "-L, --license"
Show powerman license information.
.TP
.I "-g, --genders"
Interpret targets as genders attributes rather than node names.  Each attribute
is expanded to the list of nodes that have that attribute, then those lists
are combined to make a list of target node names.
.SH EXTRA OPTIONS
The following options may or may not be available, depending on whether or
not the device implements them.
.TP
.I "-r, --reset targets"
Assert hardware reset for targets.
.TP
.I "-f, --flash targets"
Turn beacon ON for targets.
.TP
.I "-u, --unflash targets"
Turn beacon OFF for targets.
.TP
.I "-B, --beacon targets"
Query beacon status of targets.
.TP
.I "-b, --beacon-all"
Query beacon status of all targets.
.TP
.I "-P, --temp targets"
Query node temperature of targets.
.TP
.I "-t, --temp-all"
Query node temperature of all targets.
Temperature information is not interpreted by powerman and is reported
as received from the RPC on one line per target, prefixed by target name.
.SH TEST/DEBUG OPTIONS
The following options may be helpful in the test environment or when debugging
device scripts.
.TP
.I "-T, --telemetry"
Causes RPC telemetry information to be displayed as commands are processed.
Useful for debugging device scripts.
.TP
.I "-R, --retry-connect N"
Retry connect to server up to N times with a 100ms delay after each failure.
.TP
.I "-Z, --dump-cmds"
List the powerman protocol requests that would have been sent by this
command line, and exit.
.TP
.I "-D, --device NAME"
Displays device status information for the named device.
.TP
.I "-d, --device-all"
Displays device status information for all devices.
.SH "TARGET SPECIFICATION"
.B powerman
target hostnames may be specified as comma separated or space separated
hostnames or host ranges.
Host ranges are of
the general form: prefix[n-m,l-k,...], where n < m and l < k, etc.,
This form should not be confused with regular expression character classes
(also denoted by ``[]''). For example, foo[19] does not represent foo1 or
foo9, but rather represents a degenerate range: foo19.
.LP
This range syntax is meant
only as a convenience on clusters with a prefixNN naming convention and
specification of ranges should not be considered necessary -- the list
foo1,foo9 could be specified as such, or by the range foo[1,9].
.LP
Some examples of powerman targets follows:
.LP
Power on hosts bar,baz,foo01,foo02,...,foo05
    powerman --on bar baz foo[01-05]
.LP
Power on hosts bar,foo7,foo9,foo10
    powerman --on bar,foo[7,9-10]
.LP
Power on foo0,foo4,foo5
    powerman --on foo[0,4-5]
.LP
As a reminder to the reader, some shells will interpret brackets ([
and ]) for pattern matching.  Depending on your shell, it may be
necessary to enclose ranged lists within quotes.  For example, in
tcsh, the last example above should be executed as:
.nf
    powerman --on "foo[0,4-5]"
.fi

.TH powerman 1 "1 December 2008" "@PACKAGE_NAME@-@PACKAGE_VERSION@"
.SH NAME
powerman \- power on/off nodes
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pm
.I "[OPTIONS] [ACTION [TARGETS ...]]"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B powerman
provides power management in a data center or compute cluster environment.
It performs operations such as power on, power off, and power cycle
via remote power controller devices.
Target hostnames are mapped to plugs on devices in
.I powerman.conf(5).
.SH ACTIONS
.TP
.I "-1, --on"
Power ON targets.
.TP
.I "-0, --off"
Power OFF targets.
.TP
.I "-c, --cycle"
Power cycle targets.
.TP
.I "-q, --query"
Query plug status of targets, if specified, or all targets if not.
Status is not cached;  each time this option is used, powermand
queries the appropriate devices.  Targets connected to devices that could
not be contacted (e.g. due to network failure) or had some other type of
error or are reported as status "unknown".  If possible, output will be
compressed into host ranges.
.TP
.I "-l, --list"
List available targets.  If possible, output will be compressed into
a host range (see TARGET SPECIFICATION below).
.TP
.I "-r, --reset"
Assert hardware reset for targets.
.TP
.I "-f, --flash"
Turn beacon ON for targets.
.TP
.I "-u, --unflash"
Turn beacon OFF for targets.
.TP
.I "-B, --beacon"
Query beacon status of targets, if specified, or all targets if not.
.TP
.I "-t, --temp"
Query node temperature of targets, if specified, or all targets if not.
Temperature information is not interpreted by powerman and is reported
as received from the device on one line per target, prefixed by target name.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.I "-h, --server-host host[:port]"
Connect to a powerman daemon on non-default host and optionally port.
.TP
.I "-x, --exprange"
Expand host ranges in query responses.
.TP
.I "-V, --version"
Display the powerman version number and exit.
.TP
.I "-L, --license"
Show powerman license information.
.TP
.I "-H, --help"
Show command usage.
.TP
.I "-g, --genders"
Interpret targets as genders attributes rather than node names.  Each attribute
is expanded to the list of nodes that have that attribute, then those lists
are combined to make a list of target node names.
.SH TEST/DEBUG OPTIONS
The following options may be helpful in the test environment or when debugging
device scripts.
.TP
.I "-T, --telemetry"
Causes device telemetry information to be displayed as commands are processed.
Useful for debugging device scripts.
.TP
.I "-R, --retry-connect N"
Retry connect to server up to N times with a 100ms delay after each failure.
.TP
.I "-d, --device"
Displays device status information for the device(s) that control the targets,
if specified, or all devices if not.
.Tp
.I "-D, --diag"
Display diagnostic errors for power control/query failures.  Support dependent
on device support and not available on many devices.
.SH "TARGET SPECIFICATION"
.B powerman
target hostnames may be specified as comma separated or space separated
hostnames or host ranges.
Host ranges are of
the general form: prefix[n-m,l-k,...], where n < m and l < k, etc.,
This form should not be confused with regular expression character classes
(also denoted by ``[]''). For example, foo[19] does not represent foo1 or
foo9, but rather represents a degenerate range: foo19.
.LP
This range syntax is meant
only as a convenience on clusters with a prefixNN naming convention and
specification of ranges should not be considered necessary -- the list
foo1,foo9 could be specified as such, or by the range foo[1,9].
.LP
Some examples of powerman targets follows:
.LP
Power on hosts bar,baz,foo01,foo02,...,foo05
    powerman --on bar baz foo[01-05]
.LP
Power on hosts bar,foo7,foo9,foo10
    powerman --on bar,foo[7,9-10]
.LP
Power on foo0,foo4,foo5
    powerman --on foo[0,4-5]
.LP
As a reminder to the reader, some shells will interpret brackets ([
and ]) for pattern matching.  Depending on your shell, it may be
necessary to enclose ranged lists within quotes.  For example, in
tcsh, the last example above should be executed as:
.nf
    powerman --on "foo[0,4-5]"
.fi

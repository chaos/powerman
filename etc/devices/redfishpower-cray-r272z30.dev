# Powerman.conf should look something like this:
#   include "/etc/powerman/redfishpower-cray-r272z30.dev"
#   device "redfishpower" "redfishpower-cray-r272z30" "/usr/sbin/redfishpower -h pnode[1-2] |&"
#   node "node1" "redfishpower" "pnode1"
#   node "node2" "redfishpower" "pnode2"
#
# - Set your system's username/password in the login section below
#
# - This device specification was tested on a Cray with Gigabyte R272-Z30.
#
# - CAUTION: If you intend to use this file as the basis for a different
#   Redfish system, read the section "UPDATING REDFISHPOWER DEVICE FILES"
#   in redfishpower(8).

# Support for Redfish Rest Interface
#
# Powerman.conf should look something like this:
#   include "/etc/powerman/redfishpower-cray-windom.dev"
#   device "redfishpower0" "redfishpower-cray-windom-node0" "/usr/sbin/redfishpower -h pnode[1,3] |&"
#   device "redfishpower1" "redfishpower-cray-windom-node1" "/usr/sbin/redfishpower -h pnode[2,4] |&"
#   node "node1" "redfishpower0" "pnode1"
#   node "node2" "redfishpower1" "pnode2"
#   node "node3" "redfishpower0" "pnode3"
#   node "node4" "redfishpower1" "pnode4"
#
# - Set your system's username/password in the login section below
#
# - This device specification was tested on a Cray Windom.
#
# - Two specifications are listed below with a slightly different URI
#   suffix ("Node0" vs "Node1") depending on the specific node
#   attached to a blade's service processor.  Some experimentation may
#   be needed to determine which node is attached to which suffix.
#
# - CAUTION: If you intend to use this file as the basis for a different
#   Redfish system, read the section "UPDATING REDFISHPOWER DEVICE FILES"
#   in redfishpower(8).

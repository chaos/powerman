# WTI RPS-10

# Master configured for 9600 baud:
# if 9600 - wait 0.5 sec before sending next command
# if 2400 - wait 1.5 sec before sending next command
# Format of commands is ^X^X^B^X^X^B^X^XPC\r
#   where P is port number (0-9) and C is command (0,1,T,?)
#
# N.B. The 0.5 sec delays mentioned in the documentation don't seem to be
# needed on my setup...

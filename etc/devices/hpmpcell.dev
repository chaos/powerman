# Example:
#	device "rx8620-001" "hpmpcell" "rx8620-001-mp.test:23"
#	node "rx8620-001-p0" "rx8620-001" "0"
#
# Tested on:
#	rx8620 (MP firmware A.7.008, A.8.005)
#
# This handles each partition separately.  The "plug" argument to node is the
# partition number.
#
# N.B. This only works on mid-range, e.g., rx7620, rx7640, rx8620, and rx8640.
# It doesn't handle Superdome because Superdome uses "P" to select partition,
# not "R".  It should support PA-RISC systems, e.g., rp7620, rp7640, etc.

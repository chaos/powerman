# Support for Redfish Rest Interface
#
# Powerman.conf should look something like this:
#   include "/etc/powerman/redfish-supermicro.dev"
#   device "redfish1" "redfish-supermicro" "/usr/sbin/httppower -u https://pnode1 -H Content-Type:application/json |&"
#   node "node1" "redfish1" "pnode1"
#
# - Set your system's username/password in the login section below
#
# - This device specification was tested on a Supermicro H12DSG-O-CPU.
#
# - If using a slightly different model or BMC firmware version, its
#   possible the URI paths will be different.  A good starting point
#   is to run the following command to discover the correct paths:
#
#   curl -s -u USER:PASS -k -X GET https://pnode1/redfish/v1/Systems/1
#
# - This device specification has been supplanted by
#   redfishpower-supermicro.dev, which does not require fragile delays
#   to ensure power operations are complete before the script
#   returns. Users should migrate to the new one.

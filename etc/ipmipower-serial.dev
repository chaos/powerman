# This device configuration supports power control via the 
# 'ipmipower' utility.
#
# This device file is identical to the ipmipower.dev device file,
# except that power control scripts are not ranged.  Therefore, power
# control operations are passed to ipmipower serially instead of in a
# range.
#
# This device file may be more useful than ipmipower.dev on networks
# that do not scale well and require power control operations to be
# sent out more slowly.  It may also be useful when ipmipower is
# executed with the --oem-power-type option.  A number of IPMI power
# controllable devices may not be able to handle power control
# operations quickly and the operations must be slowed down.
#
# off,delay,on used in place of IPMI cycle to ensure full command
# completion before returning to the user.
